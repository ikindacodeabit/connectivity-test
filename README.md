This repository contains all the necessary parts for the connectivity test for the European Rover Challenge (ERC) 2025.

## Tips and Troubleshooting:

- When things aren't connecting properly, remove all the nodes from the group and then restart everything.
- On ROS2 Humble, you cannot make the local server run on Husarnet. It has to be on ROS2 Jazzy. The discovery nodes part should still work though.
